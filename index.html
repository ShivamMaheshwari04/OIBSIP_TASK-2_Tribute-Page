                    A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, whose full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15,
                    1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to
                    2007.Kalam's journey in the field of science and technology began when he earned a degree in
                    aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology, and in 1958, he joined the Defence
                    Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research
                    Organisation (ISRO), where he became the project director of the SLV-III, which was India's first
                    indigenous satellite launch vehicle.His contribution to the development of successful missiles
                    earned him the nickname "Missile Man," and one of the significant achievements during his tenure was
                    the launch of Agni, India's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, in 1989.<br><br>

                    Kalam played a pivotal role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as
                    a nuclear power. Although these tests raised international concerns, they also solidified Kalam's
                    status as a national hero.Beyond his technical achievements, Kalam was a visionary leader. In 1998,
                    he presented a comprehensive plan called Technology Vision 2020, outlining the path to transform
                    India into a developed society within two decades. The plan emphasized technology, increased
                    agricultural productivity, and improved access to healthcare and education.<br><br>

                    Throughout his illustrious career, Kalam received numerous accolades, including seven honorary
                    doctorates from 40 universities. He was honored by the Government of India with the Padma Bhushan in
                    1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his outstanding work with ISRO and DRDO.In 1997, Kalam was
                    bestowed with India's highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, in recognition of his significant
                    contributions to scientific research and the modernization of defense technology in the country.
                    Additionally, he received the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society in 2013, acknowledging
                    his exceptional management and leadership in space-related projects.Tragically, while delivering a
                    lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong on July 27, 2015, Kalam suffered an apparent
                    cardiac arrest and passed away at the age of 83.To commemorate his legacy, Wheeler Island, a
                    national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed Kalam Island in September 2015. Furthermore, a
                    prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road in August
                    2015, and in February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India honored him by naming a
                    newly found plant species as Drypetes kalamii.
